This analytical research paper was submitted in spring of 2023 for Honors English 110: Seminar in Composition at the University of Delaware. This specific lecture section, called Sports and Outdoors in American Culture, was taught by Dr. John F. Jebb. 

This project explores the impact that an athlete's genetic makeup has on their athletic performance. Using case studies from professional football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey, key genetic and non-genetic traits for athletic success are identified. 

The Honors English 110 course required the use of MLA 9th Edition formatting for the bibliography entries and the in-text citations. Sources come from Google Scholar and University of Delaware Library databases such as SPORTDiscus, Gale Academic OneFile, and DELCAT Discovery.
